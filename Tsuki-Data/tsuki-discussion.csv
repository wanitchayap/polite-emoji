But yeah, in regards to the ""31st Dec no snow issue"" I have managed to do some further investigations on my own and found out that: Firstly, the event is still ending *after 14 Jan 2020*. Secondly, it was really weird that only 31st Dec does not have any festival effects, ~~which seems as though someone forgot December has 31 days and coded in only 30 days instead~~. And lastly, it doesn't seems to be overwritten by any other events since nothing ended up happening on that day, so it shouldn't be a surprise New Year Eve either.
So what do you have to do? Nothing much in particular. It probably feels bad having to waste a day onto not doing anything, but it will be Christmas again after 31st Dec... though that sounds weird.

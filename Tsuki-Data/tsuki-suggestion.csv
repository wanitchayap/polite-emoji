We know that TSUKI left the village when he was a child and moved Into the city ..and then he was working .. afterwards moved into mushroom village and it was new beginning for him. 
★ it will be cool if get some Information about TSUKI's childhood and his parents . 
★ Like a place in the city where tsuki was staying before he came to Mushroom Village ..or like a new location ( closest village to the great city ) .
★ TSUKI going to that place / location meeting his old friends and it will be actually cool to bring back the old memories ..
★ Like the place where tsuki stayed ( a house or something ) or someone in that place / location giving TSUKI ..an ALBUM which consists of photos from TSUKI born to Stage where he went to work in the city . 
★ The ALBUM consists of important moments in TSUKI's Life in that period !! 
★ Moments like ; 
"" my first birthday "" 
"" First day in school "" 
"" First day in work "" 
And many cool moments also with the TSUKI's parents !! 
★ Maybe making a short CLIP whenever TSUKI seeing the album and unlocking those moments !!
